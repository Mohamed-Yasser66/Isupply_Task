# Test Automation Overview

## Project Structure:
This project is designed to perform three separate test operations. Each operation tests a specific functionality independently, and detailed documentation is provided for each test.

### Test Operations:
1. *First Test:*
   - Focuses on validating search functionality on Google.
   - Detailed explanation can be found in the [First Test README](./web_gui_test_readme.md).

2. *Second Test:*
   - Validates the file upload functionality on a sample website.
   - Detailed explanation can be found in the [Second Test README](./file_upload_test_readme.md).

3. *Third Test:*
   - Tests dynamic content loading and validation of displayed text.
   - Detailed explanation can be found in the [Third Test README](./dynamic_loading_test_readme.md).

## Purpose:
This structure ensures:
- Each test is self-contained, making debugging and enhancement easier.
- Each test has its own documentation to provide clarity and ease of understanding.

## Reports:
Automated test execution reports are generated for each test operation, summarizing the test results and highlighting any issues.
