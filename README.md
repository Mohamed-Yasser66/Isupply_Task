# Project: Test Automation Framework

## Objective:
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a simple yet effective test automation framework for both Web GUI and API testing. The framework includes sample tests to validate basic functionality and ensure the reliability of different web and API components.

## Components of the Project:

### 1. Web GUI Test Automation:
This part of the project focuses on automating user interactions and validating the functionality of web-based interfaces. The tests are organized in a folder containing three tasks:

#### First Test:
1. Navigate to "https://www.google.com/ncr".
2. Search for "selenium webdriver".
3. Check that the third result text contains "What is Selenium WebDriver?".

#### Second Test:
1. Navigate to "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/".
2. Click on "File Upload".
3. Upload any small image file.
4. Check that the file has been uploaded successfully.

#### Third Test:
1. Navigate to "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/".
2. Click on "Dynamic Loading".
3. Click on "Example 2".
4. Click "Start".
5. Wait for loading to finish.
6. Check that the text displayed is "Hello World!".

### 2. API Test Automation:
This part of the project tests API responses to ensure proper functionality and content validation. It is organized in a folder and includes the following task:

1. Navigate to "https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/".
2. Use the relevant API endpoint to get one random cat fact.
3. Check that the response "text" is not empty.

## Purpose:
This project serves as a foundational template for anyone looking to understand or implement test automation strategies. It combines Web GUI and API testing techniques to cover a wide range of scenarios, ensuring reliability and robustness in web applications and APIs.
