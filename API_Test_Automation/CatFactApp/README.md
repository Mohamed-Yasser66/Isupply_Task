# API Test Automation

## Objective:
This component of the project focuses on automating the validation of API responses to ensure they meet the expected criteria.

## Steps:
1. Navigate to the URL: [https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/](https://alexwohlbruck.github.io/cat-facts/).
2. Use the relevant API endpoint to fetch one random cat fact.
3. Verify that the response contains a "text" field and that it is not empty.

## Test Result:
After running the automated test:
- A random cat fact is successfully fetched and displayed.
- An automated test execution report is generated, summarizing the results of the test.

---
This automation ensures the reliability of the API and validates its core functionality.
